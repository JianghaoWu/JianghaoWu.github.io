#### Bio

I am a PhD student at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/), with a Master's degree from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), where I was supervised by Prof. [Guotai Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=Z2sFN4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Shaoting Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=oiBMWK4AAAAJ&hl=en). I am a member of [HiLab](https://hilab.uestc.edu.cn/). 


#### Research
My research focus on post-training adaptation of medical AI models, ranging from lightweight deep learning networks to large-scale foundation models. My research explores domain adaptation, test-time training, and self-supervised learning to enhance the reasoning-time robustness and generalizability of visual, language, and multi-modal systems in real-world medical scenarios.
