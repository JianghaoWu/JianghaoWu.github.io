I am a Master at  [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/),   supervised by Prof. [Guotai Wang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=Z2sFN4EAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Shaoting Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=oiBMWK4AAAAJ&hl=en). I am a member of [HiLab](https://hilab.uestc.edu.cn/). 

My research focuses on developing novel methods to reduce the annotation efforts for computer-aided detection and diagnosis. This includes, but is not limited to, techniques such as Domain Adaptation, Test Time Adaptation, and Self-supervised learning.
